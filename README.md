# Next.JS Blog with Markdown and MDX

I made this project to simulate a blog, using Markdown and MDX for the post content. It's a simple approach, but it helps to start a project with these features.

## How to use
1. Clone the repository
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/gabriel-santos-dev/nextjs-markdown-mdx.git
```

2. Install dependences
```bash
  npm install
```

3. Execute the project
```bash
  npm run dev
```

4. Access the project in your browser
```bash
  http://localhost:3000
```
